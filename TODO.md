Add a compilation flag to disable counters completely or make them basic, like old times

properly parse paths and fallbacks, splashes and shit

move to custom library support using ini files (crazy hard i guess) [basically do like support native libraries but build the manifest on runtime and save it on the device local storage (html5 save it on local storage or idb??) they are just file path references anyways, what about the preloader tho]
