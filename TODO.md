properly parse paths and fallbacks, splashes and shit

# new library system (currently 20/80 chances to actually work on it, if i dont work on this i will end up doing it for the mod system)

move to custom library support using ini files (crazy hard i guess) [basically do like support native libraries but build the manifest on runtime and save it on the device local storage (html5 save it on local storage or idb??) they are just file path references anyways, what about the preloader tho]
