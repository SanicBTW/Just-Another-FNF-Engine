Add proper Soloud support (Might move to BASS once I make a library for it)
- set an audio handle for soloud on FlxSound?

Paths
- fix new library system

Add a compilation flag to disable counters completely or make them basic, like old times

apparently you cant use Std on HTML5??? (HScript)

move to the latest forever engine rewrite callback method (.get(method)(this))

properly parse paths and fallbacks, splashes and shit

Add dearimgui support

move to custom library support using ini files (crazy hard i guess) [basically do like support native libraries but build the manifest on runtime and save it on the device local storage (html5 save it on local storage or idb??) they are just file path references anyways, what about the preloader tho]
