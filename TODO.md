Add proper Soloud support
- set an audio handle for soloud on FlxSound?

Transitions between states
- everything on a file and music beat state extends from it
- separated files
- think about a proper name for the state handling (not scriptable state cuz its not scriptable [why did even yoshubs call it like this on fe rewrite])
- uhhhhhhhhh

Paths
- new library system (instead of having one single preloaded, separate the files between libraries and follow a file tree schema)

Add proper network cache
- its hard wtf
