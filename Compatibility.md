# Required versions:

Even if some versions are forced, they will keep being updated monthly to sync the version code with the latest one availble.

The next libraries that will get forced will be:
- openfl to 9.1.0 with newer code to make Android compatible and implement fixes
- lime to 7.9.0 with newer code and implementing fixes

- Haxe Version: 4.3^ (You can modify the pcre2.xml file to make it Android compilable, this fix has not been added yet to Haxe but in future versions it should)
- flixel: 4.11.0
- lime: 8.0.2 (8.1.0 seems to be fucking up with assets on HTML5)
- openfl: 9.2.0 (Versions higher than 9.2.1 fuck with the Preloader screen)


# Android requires:
- openfl: 9.1.0
