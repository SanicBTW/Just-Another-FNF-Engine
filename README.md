## Branch: schmovin-ex

This branch targets on adding Schmovin' to the engine while adding more features to itself.

For example: using Interfaces instead of literal Vanilla FNF classes, etc. (I have no idea on what else to implement)

Please note that this won't use [my Schmovin' fork](https://github.com/SanicBTW/Schmovin) as a submodule since it will be added inside the source directly for easier and quicker modifications.

It will use some code from the [other Schmovin' branch](https://github.com/SanicBTW/Just-Another-FNF-Engine/tree/schmovin)

## Credits

4mbr0s3 2 for making Schmovin.
