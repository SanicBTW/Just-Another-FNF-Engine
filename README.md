# Funkin - 0.2.0

A rewrite of Friday Night Funkin' mixing Forever Engine Rewrite, Kade Engine 1.6.2 and my Psych Engine 0.3.2h fork

# Special thanks
- SlacDeveloper for making some fucking cool sprites

# Alpha Testers
- ElDulceV
- Galo
- SlacDev
- Bonndubz
- Levi
- Andy
- EchidnaWeon

# Experimental builds are published here (Experimental HUB)
All of the builds share the same assets and shit, the only thing that changes is the js file used.
I did the page in a couple of hours, don't judge me if the UI isn't working/good looking, I accept suggestions but I'm not that good in HTML
