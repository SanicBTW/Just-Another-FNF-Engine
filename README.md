# Funkin - 0.2.0

# Experimental builds are published here (Experimental HUB)
(Haven't updated the HUB and some experiments are now applied to master, sorry)
All of the builds share the same assets and shit, the only thing that changes is the js file used.
I did the page in a couple of hours, don't judge me if the UI isn't working/good looking, I accept suggestions but I'm not that good in HTML
