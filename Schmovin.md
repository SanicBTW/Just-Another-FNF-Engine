# Schmovin'

Welcome to the document that I will use to log every step I took into implementing Schmovin into the engine.

# Submodules

I added my [fork of schmovin](https://github.com/SanicBTW/Schmovin) as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) on the source folder to keep up to date with files

cmd: `git submodule add https://github.com/SanicBTW/Schmovin schmovin`

# Polymod

I removed polymod because my engine doesn't use it, but I genuinely don't know how to do it anyways.

# Scripting

Schmovin makes extensive use of HScript so import it into your project.xml.
